- Agent loop for query clarification (Goal is to have non-ambiguous query without frustrating user)
    - User inputs
    - Use web_search tool for getting latest context about research topic (which might help reducing ambiguity automatically)
    - Use check_for_ambiguous_query tool to find ambiguity
    - Use generate_clarification_questions tool to generate questions for user
    - This can go in loop until agent is confident that query is unambiguous after that it can handoff the conversation to research agent
- Agent loop for research (Goal is to collect enough data from different sites to generate final report)
    - Use search_planner (reasoning) tool to generate a search plan array
    - Use web_search tool in parallel for each item in search plan
    - This can go in loop until agent is confident that it has enough data to build the report after that it can handoff the conversation to report generator agent
- Agent loop for report generation (Goal is to generate error free and rich document which user can trust)
    - Use code_interpreter tool to plot charts and saves it as image
    - Generates report in HTML file (which includes charts if any)
    - Use report_evaluator tool reads the report and gives feedback for report
    - Use report_generator tool to update report based on feedback from the evaluator
    - This can go in loop until agent is confident for the report it generated, after that it can return report to user


- Query builder agent
    - Do a basic web search on user's input to get current situation and context
    - Builds a comprehensive query to pass to next agent
- Ambiguity detector agent
    - Analyzes the query and checks for the ambiguity
    - If ambiguity found it returns the threshold and reason
- Clarification questions generator
